Do we need a mailing list for updates?

* To present information that is not well-advertised by well-known media outlets
* To provide people with
  * more information

## Warning About Discontinuing Medication
Please note: doctors recommend that no one should attempt to withdrawal
from psychiatric drugs (Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety drugs
and ADHD drugs) without a doctor's supervision. If you have firmly decided to
discontinue medication without a doctor's supervision, you can find some guides
to medication withdrawal (a.k.a. [_discontinuation syndrome_](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-discontinuation-syndrome/)) on book-selling sites, or sites such as [The Icarus Project](http://theicarusproject.net/).

## About Andy Alt (Project Owner)
I first received treatment for mental health issues (major depression, anxiety,
PTSD) in 1991 (age 18). As a patient, I have seen numerous psychiatrists and
psychotherapists, and have been prescribed (and used) many types of psychiatric
medication. I have read many opinions on the subject of mental health, and the
negative and positive experiences consumers have had while using the mental
health care system. I have also read information written by journalists and
doctors. I have no formal education in biology, medicine, psychiatry, or
psychology.

In 1981, when I was eight years old, my father committed suicide. In 2005, I wrote 
[Damned Tears](https://medium.com/@andy011973/when-i-was-8-years-old-in-1981-my-father-committed-suicide-55b5865fffe3)
during a healing episode. Many people have told me how much they like it and one father
even told me it reminded him to stay alive for his children. I sometimes have posted
in places where suicide prevention is discussed.
